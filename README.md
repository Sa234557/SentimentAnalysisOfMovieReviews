# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

## Overview
This project aims to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using machine learning techniques. The model is built using the Large Movie Review Dataset, which contains 25,000 labeled reviews for training and 25,000 for testing.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Large Movie Review Dataset**, designed for binary sentiment classification. This dataset includes:

- **25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training**
- **25,000 highly polar movie reviews for testing**
- Additional unlabeled data for further use

Both raw text and pre-processed bag of words formats are provided. This dataset is larger and more comprehensive than previous benchmark datasets, making it suitable for training robust sentiment analysis models.

For more details, please refer to the dataset's README file provided with the release. The dataset can be accessed at the following link: [Large Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).
