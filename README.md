# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

## Overview
This project aims to classify movie reviews as positive or negative using machine learning techniques. The model is built using the Large Movie Review Dataset, which contains 25,000 labeled reviews for training and 25,000 for testing.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Large Movie Review Dataset** (IMDb), which provides a substantial amount of data for binary sentiment classification. It includes:
- 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training
- 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for testing

For more details, refer to the [dataset's README file](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).

## Results
The model is evaluated using accuracy, classification reports, confusion matrices, and ROC curves. The results are displayed visually using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
